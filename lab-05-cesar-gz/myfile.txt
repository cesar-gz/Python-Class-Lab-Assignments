jim lehrer good evening from the magness arena at the university of denver in denver colorado im jim lehrer of the pbs newshour and i welcome you to the first of the presidential debates between president barack the democratic nominee and former massachusetts governor mitt romney the republican nominee this debate and the next three two presidential one vice presidential are sponsored by the commission on presidential debates tonights minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission there will be six roughly minute segments with two minute answers for the first question then open discussion for the remainder of each segment thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects of questions via the internet and other means but i made the final selections and for the record they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates the segments as i announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care the role of government and governing with an emphasis throughout on differences specifics and choices both candidates will also have two minute closing statements the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent no cheers applause boos hisses among other noisy distracting things so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say there is a noise exception right now though as we welcome and governor romney cheers applause gentlemen welcome to you both lets start the economy segment one and lets begin with jobs what are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs you have two minutes each of you have two minutes to start the coin toss has determined mr president you go first president obama well thank you very much jim for this opportunity i want to thank governor romney and the university of denver for your hospitality there are a lot of points that i want to make tonight but the most important one is that years ago i became the luckiest man on earth because michelle agreed to marry me laughter and so i just want to wish sweetie you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of million people laughter you know four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the great depression millions of jobs were lost the auto industry was on the brink of collapse the financial system had frozen up and because of the resilience and the determination of the american people weve begun to fight our way back over the last months weve seen million jobs in the private sector created the auto industry has come roaring back and housing has begun to rise but we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do and so the question here tonight is not where weve been but where were going governor romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that well be better off ive got a different view i think weve got to invest in education and training i think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in america that we change our tax code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the united states that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild america and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments now it ultimately is going to be up to the voters to you which path we should take are we going to double down on the top down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says america does best when the middle class does best and im looking forward to having that debate mr lehrer governor romney two minutes mr romney thank you jim its an honor to be here with you and i appreciate the chance to be with the president i am pleased to be at the university of denver appreciate their welcome and also the presidential commission on these debates and congratulations to you mr president on your anniversary im sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here here with me so i laughter congratulations this is obviously a very tender topic ive had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country i was in dayton ohio and a woman grabbed my arm and she said ive been out of work since may can you help me ann yesterday was a rally in denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said ann my husband has had four jobs in three years part time jobs hes lost his most recent job and weve now just lost our home can you help us and the answer is yes we can help but its going to take a different path not the one weve been on not the one the president describes as a top down cut taxes for the rich thats not what im going to do my plan has five basic parts one get us energy independent north american energy independent that creates about four million jobs number two open up more trade particularly in latin america; crack down on china if and when they cheat number three make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world were far away from that now number four get us to a balanced budget number five champion small business its small business that creates the jobs in america and over the last four years small business people have decided that america may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a year low i know what it takes to get small business growing again to hire people now im concerned that the path that were on has just been unsuccessful the president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago that a bigger government spending more taxing more regulating more if you will trickle down government would work thats not the right answer for america ill restore the vitality that gets america working again thank you mr lehrer mr president please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle down his trickle down approach hes as he said yours is president obama well let me talk specifically about what i think we need to do first weve got to improve our education system and weve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from democrats and republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools weve got a program called race to the top that has prompted reforms in states around the country raising standards improving how we train teachers so now i want to hire another hundred thousand new math and science teachers and create million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now and i want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people when it comes to our tax code governor romney and i both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high so i want to lower it particularly for manufacturing taking it down to percent but i also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas i want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the united states on energy governor romney and i we both agree that weve got to boost american energy production and oil and natural gas production are higher than theyve been in years but i also believe that weve got to look at the energy source of the future like wind and solar and biofuels and make those investments so all of this is possible now in order for us to do it we do have to close our deficit and one of the things im sure well be discussing tonight is how do we deal with our tax code and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way but also how do we have enough revenue to make those investments and this is where theres a difference because governor romneys central economic plan calls for a trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the bush tax cuts so thats another trillion and trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnt asked for thats trillion how we pay for that reduce the deficit and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs on the middle class americans i think is one of the central questions of this campaign mr lehrer both of you have spoken about a lot of different things and were going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can but first governor romney do you have a question that youd like to ask the president directly about something he just said mr romney well sure id like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece first of all i dont have a trillion tax cut i dont have a tax cut of a scale that youre talking about my view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class but im not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high income people high income people are doing just fine in this economy theyll do fine whether youre president or i am the people who are having the hard time right now are middle income americans under the presidents policies middle income americans have been buried theyre theyre just being crushed middle income americans have seen their income come down by this is a this is a tax in and of itself ill call it the economy tax its been crushing the same time gasoline prices have doubled under the president electric rates are up food prices are up health care costs have gone up by a family middle income families are being crushed and so the question is how to get them going again and ive described it its energy and trade the right kind of training programs balancing our budget and helping small business those are the the cornerstones of my plan but the president mentioned a couple of other ideas and ill just note first education i agree education is key particularly the future of our economy but our training programs right now we got of them housed in the federal government reporting to eight different agencies overhead is overwhelming we got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to getting the training they need for jobs that will really help them the second area taxation we agree; we ought to bring the tax rates down and i do both for corporations and for individuals but in order for us not to lose revenue have the government run out of money i also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth the third area energy energy is critical and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the us is up but not due to his policies in spite of his policies mr president all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land not on government land on government land your administration has cut the number of permits and license in half if im president ill double them and also get the the oil from offshore and alaska and ill bring that pipeline in from canada and by the way i like coal im going to make sure we continue to burn clean coal people in the coal industry feel like its getting crushed by your policies i want to get america and north america energy independent so we can create those jobs and finally with regards to that tax cut look im not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the the revenues going to the government my my number one principle is therell be no tax cut that adds to the deficit i want to underline that no tax cut that adds to the deficit but i do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle income americans and i and to do that that also means that i cannot reduce the burden paid by high income americans so any any language to the contrary is simply not accurate mr lehrer mr president president obama well i think lets talk about taxes because i think its instructive now four years ago when i stood on this stage i said that i would cut taxes for middle class families and thats exactly what i did we cut taxes for middle class families by about and the reason is because i believe we do best when the middle class is doing well and by giving them those tax cuts they had a little more money in their pocket and so maybe they can buy a new car they are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through they can buy a computer for their kid whos going off to college which means theyre spending more money businesses have more customers businesses make more profits and then hire more workers now governor romneys proposal that he has been promoting for months calls for a trillion tax cut on top of trillion of additional spending for our military and he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions the problem is that hes been asked a over a hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes and he hasnt been able to identify them but im going to make an important point here jim mr lehrer all right president obama when you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals can are currently taking advantage of if you take those all away you dont come close to paying for trillion in tax cuts and trillion in additional military spending and thats why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet governor romneys pledge of not reducing the deficit or or or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle class families the average middle class family with children would pay about more now thats not my analysis; thats the analysis of economists who have looked at this and and that kind of top top down economics where folks at the top are doing well so the average person making million bucks is getting a tax break while middle class families are burdened further thats not what i believe is a recipe for economic growth mr lehrer all right what is the difference mr romney well mr lehrer lets just stay on taxes for mr romney but i but i right right mr lehrer ok yeah just lets just stay on taxes for a moment mr romney yeah well but but mr lehrer what is the difference mr romney virtually every virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate mr lehrer all right go mr romney so so if if the tax plan he described were a tax plan i was asked to support id say absolutely not im not looking for a trillion tax cut what ive said is i wont put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit thats part one so theres no economist can say mitt romneys tax plan adds trillion dollars if i say i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan number two i will not reduce the share paid by high income individuals i i know that you and your running mate keep saying that and i know its a popular things to say with a lot of people but its just not the case look i got five boys im used to people saying something thats not always true but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping ill believe it scattered laughter but that that is not the case all right i will not reduce the taxes paid by high income americans and number three i will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle income families i will lower taxes on middle income families now you cite a study there are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say its completely wrong i saw a study that came out today that said youre going to raise taxes by dollars to on on middle income families there are all these studies out there but lets get to the bottom line that is i want to bring down rates i want to bring down the rates down at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth so we keep getting the revenue we need and you think well then why lower the rates and the reason is because small business pays that individual rate fifty four percent of americas workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate and if we lower that rate they will be able to hire more people for me this is about jobs mr lehrer all right thats where we started mr romney this is about getting jobs for the american people mr lehrer yeah do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan president obama well for months hes been running on this tax plan and now five weeks before the election hes saying that his big bold idea is never mind and the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you describe governor then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class its its math its arithmetic now governor romney and i do share a deep interest in encouraging small business growth so at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 9 percent of families i also lowered taxes for small businesses times and what i want to do is continue the tax rates the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families but i have said that for incomes over a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when bill clinton was president when we created million new jobs went from deficit to surplus and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot and the reason this is important is because by doing that we can not only reduce the deficit we can not only encourage job growth through small businesses but were also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy and we do have a difference though when it comes to definitions of small business now under under my plan percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up governor romney says well those top percent theyre the job creators theyd be burdened but under governor romneys definition there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses donald trump is a small business and i know donald trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything but but thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income and that kind of approach i believe will not grow our economy because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research all the things that are helping america grow and i think that would be a mistake mr lehrer all right mr romney jim let me just come back on that on that point mr lehrer just for the just for the record mr romney these small businesses were talking about mr lehrer excuse me just so everybody understands mr romney yeah mr lehrer were way over our first minutes mr romney its fun isnt it mr lehrer its ok its great president obama thats ok mr lehrer no problem no you dont have you dont have a problem i dont have a problem because were still on the economy but were going to come back to taxes and were going to move on to the deficit and a lot of other things too ok but go ahead sir mr romney you bet well president youre mr president youre absolutely right which is that with regards to percent of the businesses are not not taxed at the percent tax rate theyre taxed at a lower rate but those businesses that are in the last percent of businesses happen to employ half half of all of the people who work in small business those are the businesses that employ one quarter of all the workers in america and your plan is take their tax rate from percent to percent now i talked to a guy who has a very small business hes in the electronics business in in st louis he has four employees he said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes federal income tax federal payroll tax state income tax state sales tax state property tax gasoline tax it added up to well over percent of what they earned and your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from percent to percent the national federation of independent businesses has said that will cost jobs i dont want to cost jobs my priority is jobs and so what i do is i bring down the tax rates lower deductions and exemptions the same idea behind bowles simpson by the way get the rates down lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobs because theres nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working earning more money paying chuckles more taxes thats by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced president obama jim i you may want to move on to another topic but i would just say this to the american people if you believe that we can cut taxes by trillion and add trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for trillion just to give you a sense over years thats more than our entire defense budget and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well to do somehow you will not end up picking up the tab then governor romneys plan may work for you but i think math common sense and our history shows us thats not a recipe for job growth look weve tried this weve tried both approaches the approach that governor romneys talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in and and we ended up with the slowest job growth in years we ended up moving from surplus to deficits and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression bill clinton tried the approach that im talking about we created million new jobs we went from deficit to surplus and businesses did very well so in some ways weve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for americans and i believe that the economy works best when middle class families are getting tax breaks so that theyve got some money in their pockets and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure were not blowing up the deficit mr lehrer ok inaudible mr romney jim the president began this segment so i think i get the last word so im going to take it all right chuckles mr lehrer well youre going to get the first word in the next segment mr romney well but but he gets the first word of that segment i get the last word of that segment i hope let me just make this comment president obama chuckles he can you can have it he can mr romney first of all mr lehrer thats not how it works mr romney let me let me repeat let me repeat what i said inaudible im not in favor of a trillion tax cut thats not my plan my plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit thats point one so you may keep referring to it as a trillion tax cut but thats not my plan president obama ok mr romney number two lets look at history my plan is not like anything thats been tried before my plan is to bring down rates but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in but that we bring down rates to get more people working my priority is putting people back to work in america theyre suffering in this country and we talk about evidence look at the evidence of the last four years its absolutely extraordinary weve got million people out of work or stop looking for work in this country mr lehrer all right mr romney its just its weve got we got when the president took office million people on food stamps; million on food stamps today economic growth this year slower than last year and last year slower than the year before going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the american people who are struggling today mr lehrer all right lets talk were still on the economy this is theoretically now a second segment still on the economy and specifically on what do about the federal deficit the federal debt and the question you each have two minutes on this and governor romney you go first because the president went first on segment one and the question is this what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country mr romney well good im glad you raised that and its a its a critical issue i think its not just an economic issue i think its a moral issue i think its frankly not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principle all their lives and the amount of debt were adding at a trillion a year is simply not moral so how do we deal with it well mathematically there are there are three ways that you can cut a deficit one of course is to raise taxes number two is to cut spending and number three is to grow the economy because if more people work in a growing economy theyre paying taxes and you can get the job done that way the presidents would president would prefer raising taxes i understand the problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth and you could never quite get the job done i want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time what things would i cut from spending well first of all i will eliminate all programs by this test if they dont pass it is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from china to pay for it and if not ill get rid of it care is on my list i apologize mr president i use that term with all respect president obama i like it mr romney good ok good laughter so ill get rid of that im sorry jim im going to stop the subsidy to pbs im going to stop other things i like pbs i love big bird i actually like you too but im not going to im not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from china to pay for it thats number one number two ill take programs that are currently good programs but i think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to state number three ill make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees combine some agencies and departments my cutbacks will be done through attrition by the way this is the approach we have to take to get america to a balanced budget the president said hed cut the deficit in half unfortunately he doubled it trillion dollar deficits for the last four years the presidents put it in place as much public debt almost as much debt held by by the public as all prior presidents combined mr lehrer mr president two minutes president obama when i walked in the oval office i had more than a trillion dollar deficit greeting me and we know where it came from two wars that were paid for on a credit card two tax cuts that were not paid for and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for and then a massive economic crisis and despite that what weve said is yes we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a great depression but what weve also said is lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow so government programs everything from aircrafts that the air force had ordered but werent working very well eighteen government government programs for education that were well intentioned but werent helping kids learn we went after medical fraud in medicare and medicaid very aggressively more aggressively than ever before and have saved tens of billions of dollars fifty billion dollars of waste taken out of the system and i worked with democrats and republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since dwight eisenhower now we all know that weve got to do more and so ive put forward a specific trillion deficit reduction plan its on a website you can look at all the numbers what cuts we make and what revenue we raise and the way we do it is for every cut we ask for a dollar of additional revenue paid for as i indicated earlier by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit and governor romney earlier mentioned the bowles simpson commission well thats how the commission bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts and this is a major difference that governor romney and i have let let me just finish this point because youre looking for contrast you know when governor romney stood on a stage with other republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked would you take of spending cuts for just of revenue and he said no now if you take such an unbalanced approach then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education it means that governor romney talked about medicaid and how we could send it back to the states but effectively this means a percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes for kids who are with disabilities mr lehrer mr president im sorry president obama and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward mr lehrer way over the two minutes president obama sorry mr lehrer governor what about simpson bowles will you support simpson bowles mr romney simpson bowles the president should have grabbed that mr lehrer no i mean do you support simpson bowles mr romney i have my own plan its not the same as simpson bowles but in my view the president should have grabbed it if you wanted to make some adjustments to it take it go to congress fight for it president obama thats what weve done made some adjustments to it; and were putting it forward before congress right now a trillion plan a balanced mr romney but youve been but youve been president four years youve been president four years you said youd cut the deficit in half its now four years later we still have trillion dollar deficits the cbo says well have a trillion dollar deficit each of the next four years if youre re elected well get to a trillion dollar debt you have said before youd cut the deficit in half and this four i love this idea of trillion dollars in cuts youve found trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget except we still show trillion dollar deficits every year that doesnt get the job done let me come back and say why is that i dont want to raise taxes why dont i want to raise taxes on people and actually you said it back in you said look im going to extend the tax policies that we have now im not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economys growing slow like this when were in recession you shouldnt raise taxes on anyone well the economy is still growing slow as a matter of fact its growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement and so if you believe the same thing you just dont want to raise taxes on people and the reality is its not just wealthy people you mentioned donald trump its not just donald trump youre taxing; its all those businesses that employ one quarter of the workers in america these small businesses that are taxed as individuals you raise taxes and you kill jobs thats why the national federation of independent businesses said your plan will kill jobs i dont want to kill jobs in this environment let me make one more point and thats and that mr lehrer lets let him answer the taxes thing for a moment ok mr romney ok mr lehrer mr president president obama well weve had this discussion before mr lehrer no about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue in addition to cuts president obama there has to be revenue in addition to cuts now governor romney has ruled out revenue hes hes ruled out revenue mr lehrer thats true right mr romney absolutely president obama ok so mr lehrer completely mr romney i look the revenue i get is by more people working getting higher pay paying more taxes thats how we get growth and how we balance the budget but the idea of taxing people more putting more people out of work youll never get there you never balance the budget by raising taxes spain spain spends percent of their total economy on government were now spending percent of our economy on government i dont want to go down the path to spain i want to go down the path of growth that puts americans to work with more money coming in because theyre working mr lehrer yeah but mr president youre saying in order to get it the job done its got to be balanced youve got to have president obama if were serious weve got to take a balanced responsible approach and by the way this is not just when it comes to individual taxes lets talk about corporate taxes now ive identified areas where we can right away make a change that i believe would actually help the economy the the oil industry gets billion a year in corporate welfare basically they get deductions that those small businesses that governor romney refers to they dont get now does anybody think that exxonmobil needs some extra money when theyre making money every time you go to the pump why wouldnt we want to eliminate that why wouldnt we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets my attitude is if you got a corporate jet you can probably afford to pay full freight not get a special break for it when it comes to corporate taxes governor romney has said he wants to in a revenue neutral way close loopholes deductions he hasnt identified which ones they are but thereby bring down the corporate rate well i want to do the same thing but ive actually identified how we can do that and part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas i think most americans would say that doesnt make sense and all that raises revenue and so if we take a balanced approach what that then allows us to do is also to help young people the way we already have during my administration make sure that they can afford to go to college it means that the teacher that i met in las vegas wonderful young lady who describes to me shes got kids in her class the first two weeks shes got them some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned theyre using textbooks that are years old that is not a recipe for growth; thats not how america was built and so budgets reflect choices ultimately were going to have to make some decisions and if were asking for no revenue then that means that weve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff and the magnitude of the tax cuts that youre talking about governor would end up resulting in severe hardship for people but more importantly would not help us grow as i indicated before when you talk about shifting medicaid to states were talking about potentially a a a percent cut in medicaid over time now you know that may not seem like a big deal when it just is you know numbers on a sheet of paper but if were talking about a family whos got an autistic kid and is depending on that medicaid thats a big problem and governors are creative theres no doubt about it but theyre not creative enough to make up for percent of revenue on something like medicaid what ends up happening is some people end up not getting help mr romney jim lets we weve gone on a lot of topics there and so ive got to take its going to take a minute to go from medicaid to schools to president obama inaudible mr lehrer come back to medicaid here yeah yeah right mr romney oil to tax breaks and companies overseas so lets go through them one by one first of all the department of energy has said the tax break for oil companies is billion a year and its actually an accounting treatment as you know thats been in place for a hundred years now president obama its time to end it mr romney and and in one year you provided billion in breaks to the green energy world now i like green energy as well but thats about years worth of what oil and gas receives and you say exxon and mobil actually this billion goes largely to small companies to drilling operators and so forth but you know if we get that tax rate from percent down to percent why that billion is on the table of course its on the table thats probably not going to survive you get that rate down to percent but but dont forget you put billion like years worth of breaks into solar and wind to to solyndra and fisker and tesla and ener i mean i i had a friend who said you dont just pick the winners and losers; you pick the losers all right so so this is not this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get america energy secure the second topic which is you said you get a deduction for getting a plant overseas look ive been in business for years i have no idea what youre talking about i maybe need to get a new accountant mr lehrer lets mr romney but the the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case mr lehrer lets have mr romney what we do have right now is a setting mr lehrer excuse me mr romney where id like to bring money from overseas back to this country and finally medicaid to states im not quite sure where that came in except this which is i would like to take the medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state youre going to get what you got last year plus inflation inflation plus percent and then youre going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best and i remember as a governor when this idea was floated by tommy thompson the governors republican and democrats said please let us do that we can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor so let states one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy dont have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of medicaid they have to have let states do this and by the way if a states get gets in trouble why we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them but mr lehrer lets go mr romney but but the right the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance mr lehrer two seconds mr romney of our people and states not the federal government mr lehrer two seconds and were going on still on the economy on another but another part of it president obama ok mr lehrer all right all right this is this is segment three the economy entitlements first answer goes to you its two minutes mr president do you see a major difference between the two of you on social security president obama you know i suspect that on social security weve got a somewhat similar position social security is structurally sound its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by ronald reagan and speaker democratic speaker tip oneill but it is the basic structure is sound but but i want to talk about the values behind social security and medicare and then talk about medicare because thats the big driver mr lehrer sure it you bet president obama of our deficits right now you know my grandmother some of you know helped to raise me my grandparents did my grandfather died awhile back my grandmother died three days before i was elected president and she was fiercely independent she worked her way up only had a high school education started as a secretary ended up being the vice president of a local bank and she ended up living alone by choice and the reason she could be independent was because of social security and medicare she had worked all her life put in this money and understood that there was a basic guarantee a floor under which she could not go and thats the perspective i bring when i think about whats called entitlements you know the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks these are folks whove worked hard like my grandmother and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this so my approach is to say how do we strengthen the system over the long term and in medicare what we did was we said we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our long term deficits but to do that lets look where some of the money is going seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars we were able to save from the medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we werent overpaying providers and using that money we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of and we were also able to make a make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the throughout the system so the way for us to deal with medicare in particular is to lower health care costs but when it comes to social security as i said you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that social security is there for the future mr lehrer well follow up on this first governor romney you have two minutes on social security and entitlements mr romney well jim our seniors depend on these programs and i know any time we talk about entitlements people become concerned that somethings going to happen thats going to change their life for the worst and the answer is neither the president nor i are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees either to social security or medicare so if youre or around or older you dont need to listen any further but for younger people we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring oh i just thought about one and that is in fact i was wrong when i said the president isnt proposing any changes for current retirees in fact he is on medicare on social security hes not but on medicare for current retirees hes cutting billion from the program now he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers actually just going to them and saying were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board everybodys going to get a lower rate thats not just going after places where theres abuse thats saying were cutting the rates some percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take anymore medicare patients under that scenario we also have percent of doctors who say they wont take more medicare patients this we have million people on medicare advantage that will lose medicare advantage because of those billion in cuts i cant understand how you can cut medicare billion for current recipients of medicare now you point out well were putting some back; were going to give a better prescription program thats one thats for every dollars youve cut theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade i want to take that billion youve cut and put it back into medicare by the way we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it but the idea of cutting billion from medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of care is in my opinion a mistake and with regards to young people coming along ive got proposals to make sure medicare and social security are there for them without any question mr lehrer mr president president obama first of all i think its important for governor romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future and the essence of the plan is that he would turn medicare into a voucher program its called premium support but its understood to be a voucher program his running mate mr lehrer and you and you dont support that president obama i dont and and let me explain why mr romney again thats for future people president obama i understand mr romney right not for current retirees president obama for for so if youre if you youre or you might want to listen because this this will affect you the idea which was originally presented by congressman ryan your running mate is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance the problem is that because the voucher wouldnt necessarily keep up with health care inflation it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about a year now in fairness what governor romney has now said is hell maintain traditional medicare alongside it but theres still a problem because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors they recruit them leaving the older sicker seniors in medicare and every health care economist who looks at it says over time whatll happen is the traditional medicare system will collapse and then what youve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care so i dont think vouchers are the right way to go and this is not my own only my opinion aarp thinks that the the savings that we obtained from medicare bolster the system lengthen the medicare trust fund by years benefits were not affected at all and ironically if you repeal obamacare and i have become fond of this term obamacare laughter if you repeal it what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying more in prescription care theyre now going to have to be paying copays for basic check ups that can keep them healthier and the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they arent making seniors any healthier and i i dont think thats right approach when it comes to making sure that medicare is stronger over the long term mr lehrer well talk about specifically about health care in a moment but what is do you support the voucher system governor mr romney what i support is no change for current retirees and near retirees to medicare and the president supports taking billion out of that program mr lehrer what about the vouchers mr romney so thats thats number one mr lehrer ok all right mr romney number two is for people coming along that are young what id do to make sure that we can keep medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current medicare program or a private plan their choice they get to and theyll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them so they dont have to pay additional money no additional thats not going to happen theyll have at least two plans and by the way if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector people will be happy to get traditional medicare or theyll be able to get a private plan i know my own view is id rather have a private plan i id just as soon not have the government telling me what kind of health care i get id rather be able to have an insurance company if i dont like them i can get rid of them and find a different insurance company but people will make their own choice the other thing we have to do to save medicare we have to have the benefits high for those that are low income but for higher income people were going to have to lower some of the benefits we have to make sure this program is there for the long term thats the plan that ive put forward and by the way the idea came not even from paul ryan or or senator wyden whos a co author of the bill with with paul ryan in the senate but also it came from bill clintons bill clintons chief of staff this is an idea thats been around a long time which is saying hey lets see if we cant get competition into the medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost better quality i believe in competition president obama jim if i if i can just respond very quickly first of all every study has shown that medicare has lower administrative cost than private insurance does which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it and private insurers have to make a profit nothing wrong with that; thats what they do and so youve got higher administrative costs plus profit on top of that and if you are going to save any money through what governor romneys proposing what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewhere and when you move to a voucher system you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies and over time if traditional medicare has decayed or fallen apart then theyre stuck and this is the reason why aarp has said that your plan would weaken medicare substantially and thats why they were supportive of the approach that we took one last point i want to make we do have to lower the cost of health care not just in medicare and mr lehrer well talk about that in a minute president obama but but overall mr lehrer go ok president obama and so mr romney thats thats a big topic could we could we stay on medicare president obama is that a is that a separate topic im sorry mr lehrer yeah were going to yeah i want to get to it but all i want to do is very quickly mr romney lets get back to medicare mr lehrer before we leave the economy mr romney lets get back to medicare mr lehrer no no no no mr romney the president said that the government can provide the service at lower mr lehrer no mr romney cost and without a profit mr lehrer all right mr romney if thats the case then it will always be the best product that people can purchase but my experience mr lehrer wait a minute governor mr romney my experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost mr lehrer can we can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice a clear choice between the two of you mr romney absolutely president obama yes mr lehrer on medicare mr romney absolutely mr lehrer all right so to finish quickly briefly on the economy what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now is there too much and in your case mr president is there should there be more beginning with you this is not a new two minute segment to start and well go for a few minutes and then were going to go to health care ok mr romney regulation is essential you cant have a free market work if you dont have regulation as a business person i had to have i needed to know the regulations i needed them there you couldnt have people opening up banks in their in their garage and making loans i mean you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work every free economy has good regulation at the same time regulation can become excessive mr lehrer is it excessive now do you think mr romney in some places yes in other places no mr lehrer like where mr romney it can become out of date and whats happened in with some of the legislation thats been passed during the presidents term youve seen regulation become excessive and its hurt the its hurt the economy let me give you an example dodd frank was passed and it includes within it a number of provisions that i think have some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy one is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail and theyre effectively guaranteed by the federal government this is the biggest kiss thats been given to to new york banks ive ever seen this is an enormous boon for them theres been community and small banks have closed since dodd frank so theres one example heres another in dodd frank it says that mr lehrer you want to repeal dodd frank mr romney well i would repeal it and replace it you were not going to get rid of all regulation you have to have regulation and theres some parts of dodd frank that make all the sense in the world you need transparency you need to have leverage limits for institutes mr lehrer well heres a specific lets excuse me mr romney let me mention the other one lets talk the mr lehrer no no lets do right now lets not lets let him respond mr romney ok mr lehrer lets let him respond to this specific on dodd frank and what the governor just said president obama well i think this is a great example the reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board now it wasnt just on wall street you had loan officers were they were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldnt have been given because theyre the folks didnt qualify you had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldnt afford you had credit agencies that were stamping these as a ph great investments when they werent but you also had banks making money hand over fist churning out products that the bankers themselves didnt even understand in order to make big profits but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable so what did we do we stepped in and had the toughest reforms on wall street since the 9s we said youve got banks youve got to raise your capital requirements you cant engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting main street at risk were going to make sure that youve got to have a living will so so we can know how youre going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we dont have other taxpayer bailouts in the meantime by the way we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime with interest now governor romney has said he wants to repeal dodd frank and you know i appreciate and it appears weve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation but in the past governor romney has said he just wants to repeal dodd frank roll it back and so the question is does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of wall street because if you do then governor romney is your candidate but thats not what i believe mr romney inaudible sorry jim that thats just not thats just not the facts look we have to have regulation of wall street president obama yeah mr romney that thats why id have regulation but i wouldnt designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check thats one of the unintended consequences of dodd frank it wasnt thought through properly we need to get rid of that provision because its killing regional and small banks theyre getting hurt let me mention another regulation of dodd frank you say we were giving mortgages to people who werent qualified thats exactly right its one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had and so dodd frank correctly says we need to mr lehrer all right mr romney have qualified mortgages and if you give a mortgage thats not qualified there are big penalties except they didnt ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage was mr lehrer all right mr romney its been two years we dont know what a qualified mortgage is yet so banks are reluctant to make loans mortgages try and get a mortgage these days its hurt the housing market mr lehrer all right mr romney because dodd frank didnt anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have its not that dodd frank always was wrong with too much regulation sometimes they didnt come out with a clear regulation mr lehrer ok mr romney i will make sure we dont hurt the functioning of our of our marketplace and our businesses because i want to bring back housing and get good jobs mr lehrer all right i think we have another clear difference between the two of you now lets move to health care where i know there is a clear difference laughter and that has to do with the affordable care act obamacare and its a two minute new segment and its that means two minutes each and you go first governor romney you wanted repeal you want the affordable care act repealed why mr romney i sure do well in part it comes again from my experience i was in new hampshire a woman came to me and she said look i cant afford insurance for myself or my son i met a couple in appleton wisconsin and they said were thinking of dropping our insurance; we cant afford it and the number of small businesses ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford it the cost of health care is just prohibitive and and weve got to deal with cost and unfortunately when when you look at obamacare the congressional budget office has said it will cost a year more than traditional insurance so its adding to cost and as a matter of fact when the president ran for office he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by a family instead its gone up by that amount so its expensive expensive things hurt families so thats one reason i dont want it second reason it cuts billion from medicare to pay for it i want to put that money back in medicare for our seniors number three it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have i dont like that idea fourth there was a survey done of small businesses across the country it said whats been the effect of obamacare on your hiring plans and three quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people i just dont know how the president could have come into office facing million people out of work rising unemployment an economic crisis at the at the kitchen table and spent his energy and passion for two years fighting for obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the american people it has killed jobs and the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state and then lets focus on getting the costs down for people rather than raising it with the additional premium mr lehrer mr president the argument against repeal president obama well four years ago when i was running for office i was traveling around and having those same conversations that governor romney talks about and it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees; it wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit our overall health care costs but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick millions of families all across the country if they had a pre existing condition they might not be able to get coverage at all if they did have coverage insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit and so as a consequence theyre paying their premiums somebody gets really sick lo and behold they dont have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit so we did work on this alongside working on jobs because this is part of making sure that middle class families are secure in this country and let me tell you exactly what obamacare did number one if youve got health insurance it doesnt mean a government take over you keep your own insurance you keep your own doctor but it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around they cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits they have to let you keep your kid on their insurance your insurance plan till youre years old and it also says that theyre youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care number two if you dont have health insurance were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market now the last point id make before mr lehrer two minutes president obama before mr lehrer two minutes is up sir president obama no i i think ive i had five seconds before you interrupted me was laughter that the irony is that weve seen this model work really well in massachusetts because governor romney did a good thing working with democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there it hasnt destroyed jobs and as a consequence we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down cost as opposed to just mr lehrer your five president obama leaving millions of people out in the cold mr lehrer your five seconds went away a long time ago laughter president obama that mr lehrer all right governor governor tell the tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about obamacare mr romney well i did with my first statement president obama you did mr romney but ill go on president obama please elaborate mr romney ill elaborate exactly right first of all i like the way we did it in massachusetts i like the fact that in my state we had republicans and democrats come together and work together what you did instead was to push through a plan without a single republican vote as a matter of fact when massachusetts did something quite extraordinary elected a republican senator to stop obamacare you pushed it through anyway so entirely on a partisan basis instead of bringing america together and having a discussion on this important topic you pushed through something that you and nancy pelosi and harry reid thought was the best answer and drove it through what we did in a legislature percent democrat we worked together two hundred legislators in my legislature only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished what were some differences we didnt raise taxes youve raised them by a trillion dollars under obamacare we didnt cut medicare of course we dont have medicare but we didnt cut medicare by billion we didnt put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments theyre going to receive we didnt we didnt also do something that i think a number of people across this country recognize which is put put people in a position where theyre going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted right now the cbo says up to million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year and likewise a study by mckinsey & company of american businesses said percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage so for those reasons for the tax for medicare for this board and for people losing their insurance this is why the american people dont want dont want obamacare its why republicans said do not do this and the republicans had a had a plan they put a plan out they put out a plan a bipartisan plan it was swept aside i think something this big this important has to be done in a bipartisan basis and we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties president obama governor romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis this was a bipartisan idea in fact it was a republican idea and governor romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in massachusetts could be a model for the nation and i agree that the democratic legislators in massachusetts might have given some advice to republicans in congress about how to cooperate but the fact of the matter is we used the same advisers and they say its the same plan it when governor romney talks about this board for example unelected board that weve created what this is is a group of health care experts doctors et cetera to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall because the there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis one is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured and thats been the trend line or alternatively we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective and there are ways of doing it so at at cleveland clinic one of the best health care systems in the world they actually provide great care cheaper than average and the reason they do is because they do some smart things they they say if a patients coming in lets get all the doctors together at once do one test instead of having the patient run around with tests lets make sure that were providing preventive care so were catching the onset of something like diabetes lets lets pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures theyve theyve engaged in now so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says lets use the purchasing power of medicare and medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do and the fact of the matter is that when obamacare is fully implemented were going to be in a position to show that costs are going down and over the last two years health care premiums have gone up its true but theyve gone up slower than any time in the last years so were already beginning to see progress in the meantime folks out there with insurance youre already getting a rebate let me make one last point governor romney says we should replace it im just going to repeal it but we can replace it with something but the problem is he hasnt described what exactly wed replace it with other than saying were going to leave it to the states but the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that hes offered like letting you buy insurance across state lines theres no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody whos got a pre existing condition be able to finally buy insurance in fact its estimated that by repealing obamacare youre looking at million people losing health insurance at a time when its vitally important mr lehrer lets let the governor explain what you would do if obamacare is repealed how would you replace it what do you have in mind mr romney let well actually actually its its its a lengthy description but number one pre existing conditions are covered under my plan number two young people are able to stay on their family plan thats already offered in the private marketplace; you dont have have the government mandate that for that to occur but lets come back to something the president i agree on which is the the key task we have in health care is to get the costs down so its more affordable for families and and then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government an unelected board appointed board who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have president obama no it isnt mr romney in my opinion the government is not effective in in bringing down the cost of almost anything as a matter of fact free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs than the government will ever be your example of the cleveland clinic is my case in point along with several others i could describe this is the private market these are small these are enterprises competing with each other learning how to do better and better jobs i used to consult to businesses excuse me to hospitals and to health care providers i was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the american people in order to bring the cost of health care down we dont need to have a an a board of people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have we instead need to put insurance plans providers hospitals doctors on targets such that they have an incentive as you say performance pay for doing an excellent job for keeping costs down and thats happening intermountain health care does it superbly well president obama they do mr romney mayo clinic is doing it superbly well cleveland clinic others but the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across america telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have thats the wrong way to go the private market and individual responsibility always work best president obama let me just point out first of all this board that were talking about cant make decisions about what treatments are given thats explicitly prohibited in the law but lets go back to what governor romney indicated that under his plan he would be able to cover people with pre existing conditions well actually governor that isnt what your plan does what your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law which says if you are out of health insurance for three months then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company cant deny you if youve if its been under days but thats already the law and that doesnt help the millions of people out there with pre existing conditions theres a reason why governor romney set up the plan that he did in massachusetts it wasnt a government takeover of health care it was the largest expansion of private insurance but what it does say is that insurers youve got to take everybody now that also means that youve got more customers but when governor romney says that hell replace it with something but cant detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in massachusetts is because there isnt a better way of dealing with the pre existing conditions problem it it just reminds me of you know he says that hes going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan thats how its going to be paid for but we dont know the details he says that hes going to replace dodd frank wall street reform but we dont know exactly which ones he wont tell us he now says hes going to replace obamacare and assure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you dont have to worry and at some point i think the american people have to ask themselves is the reason that governor romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because theyre too good is is it because that somehow middle class families are going to benefit too much from them no the the reason is because when we reform wall street when we tackle the problem of pre existing conditions then you know these are tough problems and weve got to make choices and the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle class families all across the country mr lehrer all right were going to move to a mr romney no i i have to respond to that mr lehrer no but mr romney which is which is my experience as a governor is if i come in and and lay down a piece of legislation and say its my way or the highway i dont get a lot done what i do is the same way that tip oneill and ronald reagan worked together some years ago when ronald reagan ran for office he laid out the principles that he was going to foster he said he was going to lower tax rates he said he was going to broaden the base youve said the same thing youre going to simplify the tax code broaden the base those are my principles i want to bring down the tax burden on middle income families and im going to work together with congress to say ok what are the various ways we could bring down deductions for instance one way for instance would be to have a single number make up a number dollars anybody can have deductions up to that amount and then that number disappears for high income people thats one way one could do it one could follow bowles simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way there are alternatives to accomplish the objective i have which is to bring down rates broaden the base simplify the code and create incentives for growth and with regards to health care you had remarkable details with regards to my pre existing condition plan you obviously studied up on on my plan in fact i do have a plan that deals with people with pre existing conditions thats part of my health care plan and what we did in massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state and i said that at that time the federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the th amendment which gives states the rights for these kinds of things is not the course for america to have a stronger more vibrant economy mr lehrer that is a terrific segue to our next segment and is the role of government and lets see role of government and it is you are first on this mr president the question is this do you believe both of you but you have the first two minutes on this mr president do you believe theres a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government president obama well i definitely think there are differences mr lehrer and yeah president obama the first role of the federal government is to keep the american people safe thats its most basic function and as commander in chief that is something that ive worked on and thought about every single day that ive been in the oval office but i also believe that government has the capacity the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the american people can succeed look the genius of america is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business work on an idea make their own decisions but as abraham lincoln understood there are also some things we do better together so in the middle of the civil war abraham lincoln said lets help to finance the transcontinental railroad lets start the national academy of sciences lets start land grant colleges because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all americans because if all americans are getting opportunity were all going to be better off that doesnt restrict peoples freedom; that enhances it and so what ive tried to do as president is to apply those same principles and when it comes to education what ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working we use something called race to the top wasnt a top down approach governor what weve said is to states well give you more money if you initiate reforms and as a consequence you had states around the country who have made a real difference but what ive also said is lets hire another hundred thousand math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed and hard pressed states right now cant all do that in fact weve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years and governor romney doesnt think we need more teachers i do because i think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help it cant do it all but it can make a difference and as a consequence well have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where weve got a skilled workforce mr lehrer two minutes governor on the role of government your view mr romney well first i love great schools massachusetts our schools are ranked number one of all states and the key to great schools great teachers so i reject the idea that i dont believe in great teachers or more teachers every school district every state should make that decision on their own the role of government look behind us the constitution and the declaration of independence the role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents first life and liberty we have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people and that means the military second to none i do not believe in cutting our military i believe in maintaining the strength of americas military second in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights i believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country that statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose i interpret that as one making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared by by one another were a nation that believes were all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties those that are elderly and have problems and challenges those that disabled we care for them and we look for discovery and innovation all these thing desired out of the american heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens but we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals and what were seeing right now is in my view a a trickle down government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams and its not working and the proof of that is million people out of work the proof of that is one out of six people in poverty the proof of that is weve gone from million on food stamps to million on food stamps the proof of that is that percent of college graduates this year cant find work president obama inaudible mr romney we know that the path were taking is not working its time for a new path mr lehrer all right lets go through some specifics in terms of what how each of you views the role of government how do education does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in america mr romney well the primary responsibility for education is is of course at the state and local level but the federal government also can play a very important role and i and i agree with secretary arne duncan hes theres some ideas hes put forward on race to the top not all of them but some of them i agree with and congratulate him for pursuing that the federal government can get local and and state schools to do a better job my own view by the way is ive added to that i happen to believe i want the kids that are getting federal dollars from idea or or title i these are disabled kids or or poor kids or or lower income kids rather i want them to be able to go to the school of their choice so all federal funds instead of going to the to the state or to the school district id have go if you will follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their their their student mr lehrer how do you see the federal governments responsibility to as i say to improve the quality of public education in this country president obama well as ive indicated i think that it has a significant role to play through our race to the top program weve worked with republican and democratic governors to initiate major reforms and theyre having an impact right now mr lehrer do you think you have a difference with your views and those of governor romney on about education and the federal government president obama you know this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices so when governor romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him and to pay for it were having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education that makes a difference you know his running mate congressman ryan put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that governor romneys talked about and it wasnt very detailed this seems to be a trend but but what it did do is to if you extrapolated how much money were talking about youd look at cutting the education budget by up to percent when it comes to community colleges we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now and one of the things i suspect governor romney and i probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that theyre setting up their training programs mr lehrer do you agree governor president obama let let let me just finish the point mr romney oh yeah oh yeah president obama i suspect itll be a small agreement mr romney its going over well in my state by the way yeah president obama the where their partnering so that theyre designing training programs and people who are going through them know that theres a job waiting for them if they complete them that makes a big difference but that requires some federal support let me just say one final example when it comes to making college affordable whether its two year or four year one of the things that i did as president was we were sending billion to banks and lenders as middle men for the student loan program even though the loans were guaranteed so there was no risk for the banks or the lenders but they were taking billions out of the system and we said why not cut out the middle man and as a consequence what weve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance lower or keep low interest rates on student loans and this is an example of where our priorities make a difference governor romney i genuinely believe cares about education but when he tells a student that you know you should borrow money from your parents to go to college you know that indicates the degree to which you know there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself folks like michelle kids probably who attend university of denver just dont have that option and for us to be able to make sure that theyve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door that is vitally important not just to those kids its how were going to grow this economy over the long term mr lehrer were running out of time mr romney jim jim mr lehrer im certainly going give you a chance to respond to that yes sir governor mr romney mr mr president youre entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house but not to your own facts laughter all right im im not going to cut education funding i dont have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college im planning on continuing to grow so im not planning on making changes there but you make a very good point which is that the the place you put your money makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is you put billion into into green jobs and and i look im all in favor of green energy ninety billion dollars that that would have that would have hired million teachers ninety billion dollars and these businesses many of them have gone out of business i think about half of them of the ones have been invested in theyve gone out of business a number of them happened to be owned by by people who were contributors to your campaigns look the right course for for americas government we were talking about the role of government is not to become the economic player picking winners and losers telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive taking over the health care system that that has existed in this country for for a long long time and has produced the best health records in the world the right answer for government is to say how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective how do we get schools to be more competitive lets grade them i propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing so they can take their child to a to a school thats being more successful i dont i dont want to cut our commitment to education; i wanted to make it more effective and efficient and by the way ive had that experience i dont just talk about it ive been there massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation this is not because i didnt have commitment to education its because i care about education for all of our kids mr lehrer all right gentlemen look president obama jim i inaudible mr lehrer excuse me one sec excuse me sir laughter weve got weve got barely have three minutes left im not going to grade the two of you and say youve your answers have been too long or ive done a poor job president obama youve done a great job jim mr lehrer oh well no but the fact is government the role of government and governing weve lost a pod in other words so we only have three minutes left in the in the debate before we go to your closing statements and so i want to ask finally here and remember weve got three minutes total time here and the question is this many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock if elected in your case if re elected in your case what would you do about that governor mr romney jim i had the great experience it didnt seem like it at the time of being elected in a state where my legislature was percent democrat and that meant i figured out from day one i had to get along and i had to work across the aisle to get anything done we drove our schools to be number one in the nation we cut taxes 9 times mr lehrer well what would you do as president mr romney we as president i will sit down on day one actually the day after i get elected ill sit down with leaders the democratic leaders as well as republican leaders and as we did in my state we met every monday for a couple hours talked about the issues and the challenges in the in the in our state in that case we have to work on a collaborative basis not because were going to compromise our principles but because theres common ground and the challenges america faces right now look the reason im in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country and we face this deficit could crush the future generations whats happening in the middle east there are developments around the world that are of real concern and republicans and democrats both love america but we need to have leadership leadership in washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if its a republican or a democrat ive done it before ill do it again mr lehrer mr president president obama well first of all i think governor romneys going to have a busy first day because hes also going to repeal obamacare which will not be very popular among democrats as youre sitting down with them laughter but look my philosophy has been i will take ideas from anybody democrat or republican as long as theyre advancing the cause of making middle class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity into the middle class thats how we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses thats how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasnt advancing that cause thats how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more american products around the world thats how we repealed dont ask dont tell thats how we ended the war in iraq as i promised and thats how were going to wind down the war in afghanistan thats how we went after al qaida and bin laden so weve weve seen progress even under republican control of the house or representatives but ultimately part of being principled part of being a leader is a being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do not just saying ill sit down but you have to have a plan number two whats important is occasionally youve got to say now to to to folks both in your own party and in the other party and you know yes have we had some fights between me and the republicans when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of wall street absolutely because that was a fight that needed to be had when when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no yes that was a fight that we needed to have and so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for but also being willing to say no to some things and ive got to tell you governor romney when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party mr lehrer that brings us to closing statements there was a coin toss governor romney you won the toss and you elected to go last so you have a closing two minutes mr president president obama well jim i want to thank you and i want to thank governor romney because i think this was a terrific debate and i very much appreciate it and i want to thank the university of denver you know four years ago we were going through a major crisis and yet my faith and confidence in the american future is undiminished and the reason is because of its people because of the woman i met in north carolina who decided at to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a new job from that new training that shes gotten because of the company in minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didnt lay off workers during a recession the auto workers that you meet in toledo or detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world not just because of a paycheck but because it gives them that sense of pride that theyre helping to build america and so the question now is how do we build on those strengths and everything that ive tried to do and everything that im now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing american energy or making sure that were closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the united states or or closing our deficit in a responsible balanced way that allows us to invest in our future all those things are designed to make sure that the american people their genius their grit their determination is is channeled and and and they have an opportunity to succeed and everybodys getting a fair shot and everybodys getting a fair share everybodys doing a fair share and everybodys playing by the same rules you know four years ago i said that im not a perfect man and i wouldnt be a perfect president and thats probably a promise that governor romney thinks ive kept but i also promised that id fight every single day on behalf of the american people and the middle class and all those who are striving to get in the middle class ive kept that promise and if youll vote for me then i promise ill fight just as hard in a second term mr lehrer governor romney your two minute closing mr romney thank you jim and mr president and thank you for tuning in this evening this is a this is an important election and im concerned about america im concerned about the direction america has been taking over the last four years i know this is bigger than election about the two of us as individuals its bigger than our respective parties its an election about the course of america what kind of america do you want to have for yourself and for your children and there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening and over the course of this month were going to have two more presidential debates and vice presidential debate well talk about those two paths but they lead in very different directions and its not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go; you can look at the record theres no question in my mind that if the president were to be re elected youll continue to see a middle class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up ill get incomes up again youll see chronic unemployment weve had straight months with unemployment above percent if im president i will create help create million new jobs in this country with rising incomes if the presidents re elected obamacare will be fully installed in my view thats going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past many will lose it youre going to see health premiums go up by some per per family if im elected we wont have obamacare well put in place the kind of principles that i put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and well focus on getting the cost of health care down if the president were to be re elected youre going to see a billion cut to medicare youll have million people who will lose medicare advantage youll have hospitals and providers thatll no longer accept medicare patients ill restore that billion to medicare and finally military if the presidents re elected youll see dramatic cuts to our military the secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating i will not cut our commitment to our military i will keep america strong and get americas middle class working again thank you jim mr lehrer thank you governor thank you mr president the next debate will be the vice presidential event on thursday october th at center college in danville kentucky for now from the university of denver im jim lehrer thank you and good night cheers applause
